that can directly communicate with hAPI.

See the hAPI docs at http://api.voxel.net/docs/ for details 
of hAPI. 

This package includes the following:

• hAPI class to authenticate hAPI and make hAPI calls
• An example Xcode project that builds an iPhone application
that allows a user to make hAPI calls by entering a hAPI 
method and method parameters.

The main class methods of interest are:

- (NSDictionary *)fetchAuthTokenAndSecret:(NSString *)username 
                                 password:(NSString *)password

Given a hAPI username and password, this method will return a 
dictionary containing the hAPI Key and Secret needed to make
hAPI calls.


- (NSDictionary *)makehAPICall:(NSString *)method 
                        params:(NSDictionary *)params 
                       withKey:(NSString *)key 
                    withSecret:(NSString *)secret

Given a hAPI method (IE - voxel.test.echo) and a dictionary 
of parameters (key value pairs), along with hAPI Key and Secret
acquired from the fetchAuthTokenAndSecret method call, this method 
will return a dictionary object representation of the json output 
from a hAPI call.
